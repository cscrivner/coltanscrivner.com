      <title>The Psychology of Morbid Curiosity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you curious about what Gladiatorial fights in the Coliseum of Ancient Rome were like? Have you ever wondered how an autopsy is performed? Would you watch a documentary about a famous serial killer? If there was a supposedly haunted place in your city, would you be tempted to visit? Most people would answer yes to at least one of these questions. But why are people curious about phenomena that might be classified as morbid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there is no formal definition, morbid curiosity is typically described as an interest in or curiosity about unpleasant things, especially death. The commercial success of horror films, popularity of true crime television shows, and prevalence of violence in the news implies that the average person possesses some degree of morbid curiosity. Likewise, the presence of death-related phenomena in literature and art and the historical attraction of public executions and gladiatorial fights suggests that morbid curiosity is an old and cross-cultural phenomenon. Despite the ubiquity of morbid material in entertainment, research on morbid curiosity is largely absent from the psychological literature. Moreover, although there is evidence that morbid curiosity is a well-understood lay phenomenon and that there are individual differences in morbid curiosity, no well-validated scale exists. In this research project, I am investigating the psychological nature of morbid curiosity by creating the Morbid Curiosity Scale (MCS), evaluating its ability to predict behavioral outcomes, and assessing its relationship with personality. The MCS and morbid curiosity behavioral tasks will be assessed in online adult samples, university samples, and attendees at events related to morbid curiosity, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://odditiesandcuriositiesexpo.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Oddities and Curiosities Expo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a cabinet of curiosities I curated to test some ideas about morbid curiosity. While wearing &lt;a href=&#34;https://pupil-labs.com/products/invisible/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pupil Invisible mobile eye tracking glasses&lt;/a&gt;, participants inspect the cabinet and choose 5 items to manually inspect and 5 items to learn more about. In addition to serving as an external validation of the Morbid Curiosity Scale, the cabient of curiosities will illuminate the relationship between perceptual and epistemic curiosity.

      <title>The Allure of Violence</title>

&lt;p&gt;Discussions of violence and initiatives to curb it pervade modern political and social discourses across much of the world. However, there is still a lack of rich, interdisciplinary explanations of how people perceive, process, and make meaning from experiences of violence. While past research has focused on investigating how people understand violent conflicts and how exposure to violence relates to behavioral and life outcomes, virtually no work has been conducted on how visual attention to interpersonal violence relates to interpretation and rationalization of what is being seen. This two-year project utilizes an innovative mixed-methods approach in which we combine eye tracking and verbal descriptions to better understand how people extract and construct meaning from violent social interactions. We are also exploring the role of life experiences, such as exposure to community violence, and individual differences on visual and cognitive biases that occur when viewing violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is funded by &lt;a href=&#34;https://neubauercollegium.uchicago.edu/faculty/understanding_the_meaning_making_of_violence_bridging_perception_cognition/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the Neubauer Collegium for Culture and Society&lt;/a&gt; and is in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/marc-g-berman&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Marc Berman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://voices.uchicago.edu/bermanlab/choe/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kyoung whan Choe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://humdev.uchicago.edu/directory/richard-shweder&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Rick Shweder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://marquette.academia.edu/GabrielVelez&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gabe Velez&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://primate.uchicago.edu/dario-maestripieri.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dario Maestripieri &lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;conference.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kick off this project, we hosted a conference in which we invited a wide range of scholars, including psychologists, novelists, artists, anthropologists, engineers, and others to discuss the allure of violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out photos from the first part of the day &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/neubauercollegium/albums/72157703156661834&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on the Neubauer Collegium&amp;rsquo;s flickr page for the conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference even included a live stage-fight! Courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.colum.edu/academics/faculty/david-wooley.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fight Master David Woolley and his students&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Gruesomeness and Perceived Formidability</title>

&lt;p&gt;Impaled. Dismembered. Beheaded. The archeological, historical, and ethnographic records are replete with evidence not only of violence, but of violence that is excessive and overtly grisly. Today, internet searches readily return photos and videos of the acts of terrorist organizations, crime syndicates, and repressive regimes, all of whom not only kill their victims, but conspicuously damage them in a gruesome fashion. These actions appear to be intended to intimidate opponents. In this project we explore 1) the communicative facet of grisly acts, and 2) the thesis that the formidability of a potential antagonist is cognitively represented using the dimensions of bodily size and strength. We examine how observers impute dispositional and motivational attributes on the basis of gruesome acts and demonstrate that representations of relative formidability translate into expectations regarding the outcomes of agonistic conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.danielmtfessler.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Daniel Fessler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cholbrook01.bol.ucla.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Colin Holbrook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
