      <description>&lt;p&gt;Executions throughout history have taken many forms. For most of this time, state executions were grisly, often public, events. In times of war, placing an enemy&amp;rsquo;s severed head on a spike can serve as a powerful warning against potential invaders. Even in modern times, extremist groups will capture gruesome executions on video for the sole purpose of distribution. Why is this the case? While deterrance is likely one reason for gruesomeness, it&amp;rsquo;s not clear why this works better as a deterrant than other methods, nor is it clear that deterrance is the only reason for gruesome actions. In this project, we are exploring the possibility that gruesome actions increase the viewier&amp;rsquo;s cognitive representation of the perpetrator&amp;rsquo;s formidability. In other words, perhaps committing a gruesome action increases how formidable you are in the minds of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This project is in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.danielmtfessler.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Daniel Fessler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://cholbrook01.bol.ucla.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Colin Holbrook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
