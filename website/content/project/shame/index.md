Evidence suggests that shame is a neurocognitive adaptation that helps counter social devaluation. If this is true, then shame should be elicited when someone thinks you've done something wrong, even when no actual wrongdoing has occurd. In this project we are evaluating the role of the (mis)informed audience in eliciting shame. We are also using [eye tracking](https://pupil-labs.com) to investigate social information gathering processes that are triggered when someone is being devalued or shamed. The next steps for this project will involve analyzing hormonal mediator of shame behavior.
