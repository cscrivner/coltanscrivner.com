I'm currently a PhD student in the Department of Comparative Human Development at The University of Chicago and a Fellow at the Institute for Mind and Biology in the Behavioral Biology Lab. Broadly, I'm interested in how humans interact with and perceive one another. What are the social, cognitive, and biological factors that influence social behavior? Most of my current research centers around how people perceive potentially dangerous (either socially or physically) individuals. From this perspective, I've investigated how people perceive others who they hate, who they feel shamed by, and who are engaged in violent behavior. I use a variety of tools in my research, including hormone analysis, behavioral analysis, eye tracking, surveys, and interviews.
