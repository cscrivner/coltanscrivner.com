I'm currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of Comparative Human Development at The University of Chicago and a Fellow at the Institute for Mind and Biology in the Behavioral Biology Lab. Broadly, I am interested in the social, cognitive, and biological factors that influence social behavior. Most of my current research centers around how people perceive potentially dangerous (either socially or physically) individuals and situations. In partcular, I am interested in how people find enjoyment - and can perhaps learn something - from fictionally dangerous scenarios. From this perspective, I've conducted foundational research on the phenomenon of morbid curiosity. The basic question driving this research is why are people interested in or curious about violence and horror and what do people get from engaging in recreational fear? I use a variety of tools in my research, including hormone analysis, behavioral analysis, eye tracking, surveys, and interviews. My research on morbid curiosity and the psychology of horror has also been covered by a variety of news and media outlets, including [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2247744-horror-movie-fans-are-better-at-coping-with-the-coronavirus-pandemic/), [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/10/how-horror-movies-can-help-overcome-trauma-and-relieve-stress/), [The Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-morbid-curiosity-research-uchicago-20201014-l6br33nmrvffzmcpyndqbjfhqu-story.html), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jul/01/end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it-fans-of-apocalyptic-films), [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/movies/scary-movies-summer.html), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisonescalante/2021/01/15/why-the-zombie-apocalypse-prepared-us-for-pandemic-coronavirus/?sh=2e24bb954d46), [Nautilus](http://nautil.us/issue/87/risk/horror-fans-have-more-fun-during-a-pandemic), [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/5dzvez/horror-movie-fans-are-more-equipped-to-deal-with-the-pandemic-study-says), and [Psycom](https://www.psycom.net/scary-movies-anxiety)
