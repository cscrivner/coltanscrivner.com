Though there is no formal definition, morbid curiosity is typically described as an interest in or curiosity about unpleasant things, especially death. The commercial success of horror films, popularity of true crime television shows, and prevalence of violence in the news implies that the average person possesses some degree of morbid curiosity. Likewise, the presence of death-related phenomena in literature and art and the historical attraction of public executions and gladiatorial fights suggests that morbid curiosity is an old and cross-cultural phenomenon. Despite the ubiquity of morbid material in entertainment, research on morbid curiosity is largely absent from the psychological literature. Moreover, although there is evidence that morbid curiosity is a well-understood lay phenomenon and that there are individual differences in morbid curiosity, no well-validated scale exists. The goal of this project is to create a new Morbid Curiosity Scale (MCS) and evaluate the factor structure of the construct. The scale will be validated using online adult samples, student samples, and attendees at events related to morbid curiosity, such as the Oddities and Curiosities Expo. Finally, functional evolutionary explanations for each facet of morbid curiosity will be proposed.
